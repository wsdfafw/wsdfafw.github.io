    - Instant fly
    - Makes it easier to start flying with the Elytra. Instead of having to do some weird mid-air backflip, you can simply jump and start flying.

    - Easy fly
    - Lets you control your speed using the <kbd>W</kbd> and <kbd>S</kbd> keys and your altitude using the <kbd>SPACE</kbd> and <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> keys.

    - Stop flying in water
    - As the name says, this setting makes you stop flying in water. In vanilla Minecraft, you would keep flying and get stuck once you get into the water with an Elytra.

## Overview
ExtraElytra is a mod that makes it easier to fly with the <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Elytra" target="_blank">Elytra</a> that Mojang added in Minecraft 1.9.

## Settings
ExtraElytra has three different settings to make Elytra flying more enjoyable. They are all compatible to each other, so you can use them in any combination without causing problems.

## Bypass
ExtraElytra bypasses everything. However, the "Easy fly" option may look suspicious and may eventually get patched by NoCheat+.
