<h2>Installation</h2>

{%- if page.fabric -%}
	<p>
		Wurst 7 can be installed just like any other Fabric mod.
		Here are the basic installation steps:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Run the Fabric installer.</li>
		<li>Add the Wurst Client and Fabric API to your mods folder.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Please refer to the
		<a href="/tutorials/how-to-install/wurst-7">full Wurst 7 installation guide</a>
		if you need more detailed instructions or run into any problems.
	</p>
{%- elsif page.mc-1-7-remake -%}
	<p>
		Because this is a remake, the installation process is
		<a href="/tutorials/how-to-install/wurst-6/">the same as Wurst 6</a>.
		Just make sure that you have Minecraft 1.7.2 (not 1.7.10) installed
		in order for the Wurst installer to work.
	</p>
{%- else -%}
	<p>
		Basically just run the installer.
		See <a href="/tutorials/how-to-install/wurst-6/">this tutorial</a> for details.
	</p>
{%- endif -%}

<p>
	Also, this should be obvious, but you do need to have a licensed copy of
	Minecraft Java Edition in order to use Wurst. Wurst is a cheat client,
	not a pirate client.
