	<summary id="fabric-api-not-commonly-downloaded">When I try to download Fabric API, Chrome warns me that the file "isn't commonly downloaded".</summary>
	<p>
		This can happen when a new version has just been released.
		It just means that you're one of the first people to download that specific version of Fabric API.
		You can safely ignore this warning and download the file anyways.
