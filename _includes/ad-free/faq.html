	<summary id="why-buy-instead-of-adblocker">Why would I pay for this instead of just using an ad blocker?</summary>
	<p>
		Here are some practical reasons why you might want to buy ad-free access instead of blocking ads:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Ad blockers leave a lot of empty rectangles where the ads used to be. Buying ad-free access lets you experience this website in its cleanest form.</p></li>
		<li><p>After buying ad-free access, you can use it on all of your devices, even the ones that don't let you install browser extensions.</p></li>
		<li><p>And, of course, buying ad-free access financially supports the project whereas ad blockers financially hurt it. If I can develop Wurst without having to take time off to cover my living expenses, then you get more and better Wurst updates as a result. It's a win-win!</p></li>
	</ul>

<details class="ad-free-faq">
	<summary id="why-email">Why do you need my email address?</summary>
	<p>
		Your email address is used to send you a receipt for your purchase, and to send you a restore link if you ever get logged out. That's all. No newsletters or any of that marketing nonsense!
	</p>

<details class="ad-free-faq">
	<summary id="what-does-lifetime-mean">What does "lifetime access" mean exactly?</summary>
	<p>
		The Ad-Free Access Pass is a one-time purchase with no recurring fees and no expiration date. You can essentially use it forever, assuming that this website remains online and doesn't completely change at some point.
	</p>
</details>
<details class="ad-free-faq">
	<summary id="do-i-need-a-password">Do I need to make an account and remember another password?</summary>
	<p>
		Not quite. There are no passwords here. You just enter your email address and get an email with a link that logs you in. This is known as "magic link authentication".
	</p>
</details>
<details class="ad-free-faq">
	<summary id="multiple-devices">If I have multiple devices, do I have to buy a separate Ad-Free Access Pass for each one?</summary>
	<p>
		No, you only need to buy it once. On the device where you make the purchase, the Ad-Free Access Pass will be activated automatically. For your other devices, you can use the restore access form to connect them to your purchase. Make sure you open the restore link on the same device that you want to activate ad-free access on.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is no hard limit on how many devices you can connect. You can have ad-free access on your PC, laptop, phone, etc. all at the same time. Just remember that it's only meant for your personal use!
	</p>

<details class="ad-free-faq">
	<summary id="system-requirements">What are the system requirements for ad-free access?</summary>
	<p>
		All you need is a modern browser with LocalStorage support. That includes Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Brave, Opera, and many others.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, you won't have a great experience using the Tor Browser or the DuckDuckGo App. While these browsers do support LocalStorage in theory, they automatically delete your LocalStorage data as soon as you leave the website, which will constantly log you out of ad-free access.
	</p>
</details>
<details class="ad-free-faq">
	<summary id="email-privacy">If someone knows my email address, can they see that I have an Ad-Free Access Pass?</summary>
	<p>
		No. I've designed this whole system to be as private as possible. Typing someone else's email address into the form above doesn't reveal any information, unless you can also login to their email account and see the restore link arriving in their inbox.
	</p>
	<p>
		That said, if you're concerned about your privacy, it can't hurt to use an alias or a secondary email address that nobody knows about. Just make sure you don't forget the email address or lose access to its inbox.
	</p>
</details>
<details class="ad-free-faq">
	<summary id="restore-link-spam">If someone knows my email address, can they spam me with restore links?</summary>
	<p>
		There are rate limits in place to prevent this kind of abuse, but a few restore links will get through. If your email address is known to a lot of people, you might want to use an alias or a secondary email address that nobody knows about. Just make sure you don't forget the email address or lose access to its inbox.
	</p>
</details>
<details class="ad-free-faq">
	<summary id="change-email-after-purchase">Can I change my email address after I've purchased the Ad-Free Access Pass?</summary>
	<p>
		Yes, but this is currently a manual process. You have to <a href="mailto:hello@wurstclient.net">contact me</a> and I'll change it for you.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you still have access to your original email address, email me from there. If not, you'll need some kind of invoice or statement to prove your purchase.
	</p>
</details>
<details class="ad-free-faq">
	<summary id="wrong-email-locked-out">Help! I entered the wrong email address when I bought my Ad-Free Access Pass and now I'm locked out.</summary>
	<p>
		<a href="mailto:hello@wurstclient.net">Contact me</a> and I'll fix it. You'll need some kind of invoice or statement to prove your purchase.
	</p>
</details>
<details class="ad-free-faq">
	<summary id="turn-off-access">What if I ever want to re-enable the ads? How do I turn off my Ad-Free Access Pass?</summary>
	<p>
		Not sure why you'd want to do that, but if you clear your browsing data for wurstclient.net then you'll be logged out on that device. You'll need to request a new restore link to log back in.
	</p>
	<p>
		An easier way to log out temporarily might be to open an incognito tab. Again, not sure why you'd want that, but this is how you do it.
	</p>
</details>
<details class="ad-free-faq">
	<summary id="other-mods">Does the Ad-Free Access Pass also turn off ads for your other mods, like Wolfram or WI Zoom?</summary>
	<p>
		No. The Ad-Free Access Pass is only available for Wurst at the moment. If I release Ad-Free Access Passes for other mods in the future, those will be separate products.
	</p>
</details>
<details class="ad-free-faq">
	<summary id="refund-policy">What is your refund policy?</summary>
	<p>
		Simple: If you're unhappy with your purchase for any reason, <a href="mailto:refunds@wurstclient.net">contact me</a> within 30 days of payment to receive a full refund.
	</p>
</details>
<details class="ad-free-faq">
	<summary id="crypto-payment">Can I pay with cryptocurrency?</summary>
	<p>
		Sorry, this is not currently possible. Let me know if this is something you'd like to see implemented in the future.
	</p>
</details>
<details class="ad-free-faq">
	<summary id="use-wurst-without-minecraft">Can I use Wurst without owning Minecraft?</summary>
	<p>
		No, absolutely not. Wurst is not a pirate client. Like most other Minecraft mods and cheats, Wurst only works when you own a licensed copy of Minecraft Java Edition.
	</p>
