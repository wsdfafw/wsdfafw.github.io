## Changelog

- Target in Navigator.

- [AutoBuild](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild) Template setting in Navigator.

- [Default keybinds](https://wurst.wiki/keybinds#default_keybinds) for Navigator: Left Ctrl & Right Shift. This won't overwrite any existing keybinds, including the default ClickGUI keybind from previous Wurst versions.

- Mouse Wheel clicking a feature will now instantly do its primary action (e.g. toggle a mod), much like shift-clicking does. This seems to be more convenient than shift-clicking, as you only need to press one key instead of two.

- [Nuker Mode](https://wurst.wiki/nuker#mode) setting in Navigator.

- Any feature can now have sliders and other settings. This is no longer limited to just mods.

- "See also" section on [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator) feature screen: Basically links to other features.

- Checkbox settings for [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator) (like the ones in Target).

- Colors settings for [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator) (like the one in Target).

- Enabled the tutorial button for the features that already have a tutorial. The plan is to make a lot more tutorials and have a tutorial button on all the major features.

- BookHack in Navigator.

- ServerFinder in Navigator.

- SessionStealer in Navigator.

- A notice to ClickGUI that makes it easier to switch to Navigator.

- Improved the way settings are saved. They will now be saved in `navigator.json` instead of `sliders.json` and `options.json`. All slider values, Navigator intelligent sorting preferences and some other settings like Nuker mode and Target settings that were saved before this update will be lost. This will **not** delete any of your alts or keybinds.

- Sliders in Navigator will no longer be prefixed with the name of the feature (e.g. "Speed" instead of "Killaura speed").

- Fixed Target targeting everything if Teams is enabled and the color white is selected.
