I remember saying that I would make an automatic grief-bot one day. I was kidding when I said that, but now we're almost there.

Wurst-Bot cannot yet grief automatically, but it should now be really easy to implement that. However, by using FightBot/Protect, Regen, AutoEat, AutoSword & AutoArmor, it can already do PVP automatically. Tests on [play.WiZARDHAX.com](http://www.wizardhax.com/play) have shown that it often PVPs better than a human. It was quite hilarious to see these humans being slain by a bot... and later asking the bot what client it was using.

You need a Wurst-Bot launcher to use Wurst-Bot. A very basic one I made can be found at [GitHub.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst-Bot-launcher](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst-Bot-launcher/releases). Wurst-Bot cannot be started with a mod or command in Wurst, but this is planned for later.

#### Cool features in Wurst-Bot
- It can join any server, even premium ones, by using premium alts.
- It cannot be detected. It sends exactly the same packets as a normal Wurst user.
- It has full access to all Wurst commands, including `.t`, `.goto`, ...everything!
- Proxy support (SOCKS proxies, unfortunately).

#### Known issues
- Sometimes it doesn't respawn correctly. If that happens to you, use the `fixme` command.
- The very basic Wurst-Bot launcher can only launch one Wurst-Bot at the time. If you want to make a whole army, you'll need to make your own launcher.

#### Usage example
Joins a premium server with a premium alt and a proxy, sends some chat messages, runs some Wurst commands, leaves the server and stops.
