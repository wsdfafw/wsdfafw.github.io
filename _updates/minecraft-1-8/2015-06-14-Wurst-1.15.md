**Note:** Other Wurst versions with [OP-Sign](https://wurst.wiki/op-sign) are still available! You really don't need this super old version! _Please_ download [the latest Wurst 6 release](https://www.wurstclient.net/download/minecraft-1-8/) instead!!!

## Changelog

- Added [OP-Sign](https://wurst.wiki/op-sign): Generates a sign that can make you an admin. This sign contains a special code that causes it to run a command whenever someone right-clicks it. The command will always be executed with admin permissions, no matter who is clicking on it, so it can run commands like `/op YourName`.

- Added CrashChest: Gives you a chest that can crash other players and prevent them from joining the server (they will get a crash every time they try to join). In order for this to work, you need to fill about half of someone else's inventory with CrashChests. The point at which a player will get a crash depends on the number of inventory slots that have at least one CrashChest in them. The size of each stack doesn't matter - it is enough to have one CrashChest in each slot.

  It is also possible to place a chest in the world and fill it with CrashChests. Any player who tries to open this chest will get a crash. However, this method does not prevent them from joining the server again.

- Added Cmd-Block: Generates a command block in Creative Mode without the need for admin permissions.

- Added CrashItem: Modifies a nametag so that whenever you right click a mob with it, all nearby players will be kicked from the server.

- Added [Flight bypass](https://wurst.wiki/flight).

- Added TrollPotion: Generates a potion containing every potion effect in the game.
