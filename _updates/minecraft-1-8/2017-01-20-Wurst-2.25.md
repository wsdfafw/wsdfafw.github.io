## Changelog

- [Killaura](https://wurst.wiki/killaura), KillauraLegit, ClickAura and [BowAimbot](https://wurst.wiki/bowaimbot) will now prioritize targets based on their angle to the player's server-side rotation instead of their distance to the player. This minimizes fake-rotations made by those features, increasing their speed while also making them harder to detect.

- Added [BonemealAura](https://wurst.wiki/bonemealaura): Automatically uses bone meal on specific types of plants.

- Added FastBreak Mode setting.

- Added NukerLegit settings.

- Improved NoCheat+ bypass, range, accuracy and performance of [Nuker](https://wurst.wiki/nuker).

- Improved NoCheat+ bypass, range and accuracy of NukerLegit.

- Improved NoCheat+ bypass of [AutoBuild](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild).

- Improved NoCheat+ bypass and accuracy of Tunneller.

- Improved speed and performance of Kaboom and SpeedNuker.

- Kaboom and SpeedNuker will now work in both survival and creative mode.

- Kaboom and SpeedNuker will no longer get you kicked from the server quite as often.

- Improved accuracy of PlayerFinder.

- Changed default FastBreak mode to "Instant".

- Fixed TemplateTool not being able to scan very small objects.

- Fixed Wurst AI not climbing up vines correctly.

- Renamed the "Mineplex AntiCheat" mode in YesCheat+ to "Mineplex".

- Fixed KillauraLegit rotating too quickly.
