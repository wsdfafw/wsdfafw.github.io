## Changelog

- [AutoBuild](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild) can now have any number of custom templates instead of just one. The templates are now stored in `.minecraft\wurst\autobuild`, where you can add, remove and rename them however you like. If you want to reset the templates, just delete the `autobuild` folder. Also, AutoBuild templates now use the JSON format.

- The AltManager has got a massive security enhancement, some new features and lots of fixes. The old home-made encryption has been replaced with a shiny new AES+RSA one. That's the same stuff that Mojang uses to protect your accounts. It's also the reason why Wurst now requires Java 8. The new features include colored names, a `Star` button to mark your favorite alts and an `Import Alts` button to convert a username:password list into the encrypted format.

- Another new thing is the Wurst cape, which is currently only available to Wurst-Imperium members and friends.

**Notice:** If you are updating from Wurst 1.6.X or earlier, you need to download & run [Converter.jar](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst-MC-1.8/releases/download/v1.7/Converter.jar) first. Otherwise your keybinds are lost!
