## 更新日志

- **Fixed a crash when using Java 6 / 7:** Instead of crashing, it should now show an error message with a tutorial for how to update to Java 8.

- **Fixed the Alt Manager breaking if one of the files is missing.** In other words, if you tried to clear your alt list by deleting the `alts.json` file, the Alt manager stopped saving any of your alts.

- **Added ForcePush mod**: Pushes mobs like crazy. They'll literally fly away! More funny than useful, but still very cool.

- **Wurst Capes will now be hosted on a new server** that should allow far more capes than the old one. I'm not sure if this server will be able to handle the traffic, so if it goes down it can be switched back to the old server without requiring another Wurst update.

- **Wurst Capes will now be bound to the UUID** instead of the username, so you can now change your name without losing your cape.

- Fixed a rare crash when viewing the main screen.

## Update: Wurst 2.8.1

- Fixed chests not rendering.

- Fixed the "(outdated)" thing looking weird.

## Update: Wurst 2.8.2

- Fixed a crash.
