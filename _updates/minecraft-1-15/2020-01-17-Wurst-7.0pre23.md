## Changelog

- ExtraElytra is back!

- Added proper descriptions to ExtraElytra's settings.

- Separated ExtraElytra's "Easy fly" checkbox into a "Speed control" and "Height control" checkbox.

- Trajectories is back! (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Mersid" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mersid</a>!)

- Trajectories now also supports crossbows and tridents.

- `.features` is back!

- [`.addalt`](https://wurst.wiki/cmd/addalt) is back!

- `.damage` is back!

  **Note:** `.damage` can no longer apply more than 3.5 hearts of damage at once. To get around this, simply run the command multiple times.

- `.getpos` is back!

- `.setcheckbox` is back!

- `.setslider` is back!

- `.setmode` is back!

- Fixed Alt Manager always behaving as if you logged in successfully, even if the password is wrong.

- Fixed Alt Manager not sorting the alt list properly.

- Fixed a visual glitch on [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator)'s "Add Keybind" screen.

- Fixed a visual glitch on [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator)'s "Remove Keybind" screen.

## Working Features

Please keep in mind that this is just a pre-release! It doesn't (yet) have all of the features of Wurst 7, or all of the features of Wurst 6. Only the following features are included in this version:

{% include update/features.html hacks=site.data.hacks.since_v7_0pre23 commands=site.data.commands.since_v7_0pre23 other=site.data.other_features.since_v7_0pre20 %}

### GUIs:

- Window-based ClickGUI (which you can open by pressing **Right CTRL**).

- [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator) (which you can open by pressing **Right Shift**).

- TabGUI will be added back in later pre-releases.

**WARNING:** Do NOT use OptiFine version `HD U F4`, it has a bug that breaks X-Ray. Use version `HD U F3` instead.
