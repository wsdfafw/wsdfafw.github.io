## Changelog

- This version of Wurst is available for Minecraft 1.15.1 and 1.15.

- [AutoBuild](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild) is back!

- Added a ["Tree" template](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild#default_templates) to AutoBuild. (If you don't see this, reset your AutoBuild templates or delete the `.minecraft/wurst/autobuild` folder.)

- Removed [AutoBuild's "Mode" setting](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild#mode) (the one that let you choose between "Fast" and "Legit" mode).

  Instead, everything that made "Fast" mode different from "Legit" mode can now be changed individually.

- Added a ["Range" slider](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild#range) to AutoBuild.

  Determines how far to reach when placing blocks.

  (In Wurst 6, "Fast" mode locked this setting to 6.0 and "Legit" mode locked it to 4.25.)

- Added a ["Check line of sight" checkbox](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild#check_line_of_sight) to AutoBuild.

  Makes sure that you don't reach through walls when placing blocks. Can help with AntiCheat plugins but slows down building.

  (In Wurst 6, "Legit" mode enabled this setting.)

- Added an ["InstaBuild" checkbox](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild#instabuild) to AutoBuild. When enabled, AutoBuild builds small templates (<= 64 blocks) instantly.

  (In Wurst 6, "Fast" mode enabled this setting.)

- Added an ["Always FastPlace" checkbox](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild#always_fastplace) to AutoBuild. When enabled, AutoBuild builds as if FastPlace was enabled, even if it's not.

- Removed AutoBuild's experimental ["Use AI" checkbox](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild#use_ai).

- Fixed zooming in with the mouse wheel changing the selected slot.

- Updated Fabric API to 0.4.24+build.279-1.15 (MC 1.15) / 0.4.25+build.282-1.15 (MC 1.15.1).

- Updated Fabric Yarn to 1.15+build.2 / 1.15.1+build.6.

- Updated Fabric loader to 0.7.2+build.175. (MC 1.15.1)

## Working Features

Please keep in mind that this is just a pre-release! It doesn't (yet) have all of the features of Wurst 7, or all of the features of Wurst 6. Only the following features are included in this version:

{% include update/features.html hacks=site.data.hacks.since_v7_0pre19 commands=site.data.commands.since_v7_0pre18 other=site.data.other_features.since_v7_0pre16 %}

### GUIs:

- Window-based ClickGUI (which you can open by pressing **Right CTRL**).

- [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator) (which you can open by pressing **Right Shift**).

- TabGUI will be added back in later pre-releases.

**WARNING:** Do NOT use OptiFine version `HD U F4`, it has a bug that breaks X-Ray. Use version `HD U F3` instead.
