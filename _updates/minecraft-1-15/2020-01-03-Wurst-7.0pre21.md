## Changelog

- Zoom will now dynamically adjust your mouse sensitivity while zooming, so that high levels of zoom will not cause the camera to move too quickly. (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Mersid" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mersid</a>!)

- Fixed a bug that caused the game to crash on startup for users running Mac OS. (It is unclear whether or not Linux users were affected too.)

- Added a "Check held item" setting to [BuildRandom](https://wurst.wiki/buildrandom). When checked, BuildRandom only builds while you are actually holding a block. Turn this off to build with fire, water, lava, spawn eggs, or if you just want to right click with an empty hand in random places.

- Added an "Always FastPlace" setting to [BuildRandom](https://wurst.wiki/buildrandom). Builds as if FastPlace was enabled, even if it's not. (same as in AutoBuild)

- Improved [BuildRandom](https://wurst.wiki/buildrandom)'s search tags. For example, searching "place random", "random build" or "random place" will now find BuildRandom.

## Working Features

Please keep in mind that this is just a pre-release! It doesn't (yet) have all of the features of Wurst 7, or all of the features of Wurst 6. Only the following features are included in this version:

{% include update/features.html hacks=site.data.hacks.since_v7_0pre20 commands=site.data.commands.since_v7_0pre20 other=site.data.other_features.since_v7_0pre20 %}

### GUIs:

- Window-based ClickGUI (which you can open by pressing **Right CTRL**).

- [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator) (which you can open by pressing **Right Shift**).

- TabGUI will be added back in later pre-releases.

**WARNING:** Do NOT use OptiFine version `HD U F4`, it has a bug that breaks X-Ray. Use version `HD U F3` instead.
