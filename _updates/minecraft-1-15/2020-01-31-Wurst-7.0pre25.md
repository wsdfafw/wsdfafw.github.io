  **Note:** These filters control what you attack, not what you protect.

## Working Features

Please keep in mind that this is just a pre-release! It doesn't (yet) have all of the features of Wurst 7, or all of the features of Wurst 6. Only the following features are included in this version:

{% include update/features.html hacks=site.data.hacks.since_v7_0pre25 commands=site.data.commands.since_v7_0pre25 other=site.data.other_features.since_v7_0pre24 %}

### GUIs:

- Window-based ClickGUI (which you can open by pressing **Right CTRL**).

- [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator) (which you can open by pressing **Right Shift**).

- TabGUI will be added back in later pre-releases.

**WARNING:** Do NOT use OptiFine version `HD U F4`, it has a bug that breaks X-Ray. Use version `HD U F3` instead.
