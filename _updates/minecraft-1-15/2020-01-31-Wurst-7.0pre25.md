## 更新日志

- HighJump is back!

- SafeWalk is back!

- Radar is back!

- Tunneller is back!

- `.path` is back!

- `.goto` is back!

- Fixed the syntax for `.path` and `.goto` not saying how to turn them off.

- Follow is back!

- Added filters to Follow.

- `.follow` is back!

- `.follow` will no longer toggle Follow if no target is specified. (Use `.t follow` for that.)

- [AntiAFK](https://wurst.wiki/antiafk) is back!

- Parkour is back!

- Parkour and SafeWalk will now disable each other, since having both enabled at the same time would make SafeWalk very unsafe.

- Overlay is back!

- Excavator is back!

- Excavator will now show a preview of the area before you confirm the selected positions.

- `.excavate` is back!

- FightBot is back!

- Added filters to FightBot.

- Protect is back!

- Added filters to Protect.  
  **Note:** These filters control what you attack, not what you protect.

- Fixed Protect sometimes still rendering a path when the "Use AI" setting is disabled.

- `.protect` is back!

- `.protect` will no longer toggle Protect if no target is specified. (Use `.t protect` for that.)

- [Glide](https://wurst.wiki/glide) is back!

- Added a warning to [Glide](https://wurst.wiki/glide) saying that, unless you use NoFall, you will still take fall damage with it enabled.

- TP-Aura is back!

- Added a "Priority" setting to TP-Aura.

- Added filters to TP-Aura.

- KillPotion is back!

- TrollPotion is back!

- [HealthTags](https://wurst.wiki/healthtags) is back!

- [MultiAura](https://wurst.wiki/multiaura) is back!

- Fixed removing [keybinds](https://wurst.wiki/keybinds) through [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator) not working in some specific cases.

- Updated Yarn mappings to 1.15.2+build.8.

- Updated Fabric loader to 0.7.6+build.180.

## Working Features

### GUIs:

- Window-based ClickGUI (which you can open by pressing **Right CTRL**).
