## 更新日志 Since v7.0pre27

- ForceOP is back!

- Because Minecraft no longer supports the Swing API, ForceOP now has to run in a separate process. You will see this in task manager, but the ForceOP window itself still looks and functions the same way as previously.

- Fixed a false positive from McAfee GW Edition. See <a href="https://twitter.com/Wurst_Imperium/status/1229370457838755840" target="_blank">this series of tweets</a> for details.

## 更新日志 Since v6.31.1:

- Wurst now uses [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) instead of the MCP.

  This makes updating Wurst to future Minecraft versions a lot easier and allows us to release Wurst for Snapshots.

  It also means that the installation process for Wurst 7 is very different from the one for 6.

- Minecraft's keybinds work differently since they updated to LWJGL 3. As a result, your `keybinds.json` files from previous Wurst versions will no longer work.

- Removed the custom font, at least for now. I can't seem to get it working on LWJGL 3.

- Removed the "see also" section in [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator).

- Added AutoSwim - Triggers the swimming animation automatically.

- Added a checkbox to toggle Jesus's NoCheat+ bypass, as it seems that using the bypass will now slow down your movement. If anyone knows a fix for this, let me know!

- Added a "Method" setting to Fullbright:
  
  **Gamma** works by setting the brightness to beyond 100%. It supports the Fade effect, but isn't compatible with shader packs. This is what previous versions of Wurst did, and it's selected by default.
  
  **Night Vision** works by applying the night vision effect. This looks a bit different and _usually_ works with shader packs, but it doesn't support the Fade effect.

- Removed [AutoBuild](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild)'s experimental "Use AI" checkbox.

- Added some new Easter Eggs.

- Because Minecraft no longer supports the Swing API, ForceOP now has to run in a separate process. You will see this in task manager, but the ForceOP window itself still looks and functions the same way as previously.

- Added a ["Switch back" checkbox](https://wurst.wiki/autotool#switch_back) to AutoTool's settings. When checked, AutoTool will automatically switch back to the previously selected slot.

- [ChestESP](https://wurst.wiki/chestesp) now supports barrels and shulker boxes.

- Added a "Middle click friends" checkbox to `.friends` (you can only see this by using Navigator). Does the same thing as the button in the Wurst Options.

- Fixed ScaffoldWalk placing sand in places where it would fall.

- `.blink cancel` will now show an error message if blink is already turned off.

- Added [AntiWaterPush](https://wurst.wiki/antiwaterpush): Prevents you from getting pushed by water.

- [AntiKnockback](https://wurst.wiki/antiknockback) will no longer prevent you from getting pushed by water.

- Added a "Tree" template to [AutoBuild](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild). (If you don't see this, reset your AutoBuild templates or delete the `.minecraft/wurst/autobuild` folder.)

- Removed [AutoBuild](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild)'s "Mode" setting (the one that let you choose between "Fast" and "Legit" mode).

  Instead, everything that made "Fast" mode different from "Legit" mode can now be changed individually.

- Added a "Range" slider to [AutoBuild](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild).

  Determines how far to reach when placing blocks.

  (In previous versions, "Fast" mode locked this setting to 6.0 and "Legit" mode locked it to 4.25.)

- Added a "Check line of sight" checkbox to [AutoBuild](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild).

  Makes sure that you don't reach through walls when placing blocks. Can help with AntiCheat plugins but slows down building.

  (In previous versions, "Legit" mode enabled this setting.)

- Added an "InstaBuild" checkbox to [AutoBuild](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild). When enabled, AutoBuild builds small templates (<= 64 blocks) instantly.

  (In previous versions, "Fast" mode enabled this setting.)

- Added an "Always FastPlace" checkbox to [AutoBuild](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild). When enabled, AutoBuild builds as if FastPlace was enabled, even if it's not.

- Added [AntiWobble](https://wurst.wiki/antiwobble): Disables the wobble effect caused by nausea and portals.

- <a href="https://wurst.wiki/antiblind">AntiBlind</a> no longer disables the wobble effect caused by nausea and portals.

- Added an "Eat while walking" checkbox to AutoEat (unchecked by default).

- Added a "Prefer food with" setting to AutoEat that determines how it will decide which food to eat first. By default, AutoEat will choose the food with the highest saturation.

- Added an "Allow hunger effect" checkbox to AutoEat (checked by default). When checked, AutoEat may eat food that gives you the harmless 'hunger' effect (e.g. rotten flesh).

- Added an "Allow poison effect" checkbox to AutoEat (unchecked by default). When checked, AutoEat may eat food that gives you the poison effect (e.g. spider eyes).

- Added an "Allow chorus fruit" checkbox to AutoEat (unchecked by default). When checked, AutoEat may eat chorus fruits, which will teleport you around randomly.

- Improved AutoEat's search tags.

- Changed the [category](https://wurst.wiki/categories) of AutoEat from "Other" to "Items".

- Removed AutoEat's "Ignore screen" checkbox.

- <a href="https://wurst.wiki/antiblind">AntiBlind</a> no longer disables the wobble effect caused by nausea and portals.

- Improved the description of [AutoLeave](https://wurst.wiki/autoleave) and its settings.

- Improved [AutoLeave](https://wurst.wiki/autoleave)'s search tags.

- Improved the description of CrashChest.

- Added a "CleanUp" entry in Navigator.

- Fixed Derp, HeadRoll and Tired not disabling each other.

- Fixed `.viewnbt` crashing the game if you aren't holding an item or the item doesn't have any NBT data.

- Fixed Alt Manager counting unchecked alts as premium.

- Renamed AutoSplashPot to AutoPotion.

- Changed the category of AutoPotion from "Other" to "Combat".

- Improved the description of AutoPotion and its settings.

- Removed the "Ignore screen" checkbox in AutoPotion.

- Improved the description of AutoSoup and its settings.

- Removed the "Ignore screen" checkbox in AutoSoup.

- CaveFinder now works by highlighting caves in red.

- Renamed GhostHand to HandNoClip.

- HandNoClip now supports multiple different blocks at the same time.

- HandNoClip's blocks can now be changed through its settings, without requiring a command.

- Removed `.ghosthand`, as it's now obsolete.

- Renamed Criticals' "Jump" mode to "Mini Jump".

- Added A "Full Jump" mode to Criticals that actually performs a normal jump.

- Criticals will now display its mode in the HackList.

- Added a ["Priority" setting](https://wurst.wiki/bowaimbot#priority) to BowAimbot.

- Added [filters](https://wurst.wiki/bowaimbot#filter_players) to BowAimbot.

- Added crossbow support to [BowAimbot](https://wurst.wiki/bowaimbot).

- Added an "Amount" slider to Throw.

- Removed `.throw`, as it's now obsolete.

- Improved some of `.potion`'s error messages.

- AutoSword will now switch to a weapon as soon as you are looking at an entity, rather than waiting until you attack it.

- Added a "Priority" setting to AutoSword. Determines whether AutoSword will choose a weapon with high damage (axe) or high speed (sword).

- Added a "Switch back" checkbox to AutoSword. Determines whether or not AutoSword will switch back to the previously selected slot after switching to a weapon.

- Added a "Release time" setting to AutoSword: Determines how long AutoSword will hold on the weapon after selecting it. Default: 10 ticks (0.5 seconds)

- Added error messages to InstantBunker (e.g. if you are not holding blocks).

- InstantBunker will now make you jump in order to build the bunker properly. (It's 3 blocks tall and the game now understands that you can't reach the third layer without jumping. If you are standing in a 2 blocks tall space, the third layer will not be built.)

- Added InfiniChat: Removes the 256 character limit from the chat. Useful for long commands that modify NBT data.

- Changed the maximum Step Height to 10 blocks, since higher values no longer work.

- RemoteView will now adjust your view for the height of the entity that you are viewing.

- PlayerFinder will now show a chat message when it has detected a player.

- `.give` can now create a stack of up to 64 items, even for limited or non-stackable items.

- Added NoPumpkin: Blocks the overlay when wearing a pumpkin on your head.

- Added NoFireOverlay: Blocks the overlay when you are on fire.

- NoOverlay will no longer disable the overlays of pumpkins and fire.

- Added a "Prevent slowdown" checkbox to AntiWaterPush: Allows you to walk underwater at full speed.

- NoSlowdown will no longer prevent slowness caused by being underwater. (Use the "Prevent slowdown" checkbox in AntiWaterPush instead.)

- AutoReconnect is now a hack. This allows you to toggle it on and off without having to get kicked first.
