## 更新日志

- Wurst now uses [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) instead of the MCP.

  This will make updating Wurst to future Minecraft versions a lot easier and may even allow us to release Wurst for Snapshots.

  It also means that the installation process for Wurst 7.x will be very different from the one for 6.x. (see below for instructions)

- Minecraft's keybinds work differently since they updated to LWJGL 3. As a result, your `keybinds.json` files from previous Wurst versions will no longer work.

- You can now use keybinds while the ClickGUI is open.

- Removed the custom font, at least for now. I can't seem to get it working on LWJGL 3.

- <del>Fixed [MobSpawnESP](https://wurst.wiki/mobspawnesp) sometimes causing the game to crash.</del> Unfortunately this fix is not working properly. It _should_ be fixed in v7.0pre2.

## Working Features

Since this is an early pre-release, it does not yet have all of the features of Wurst 7.0.

{% include update/features.html hacks=site.data.hacks.since_v7_0pre1 commands=site.data.commands.since_v7_0pre1 %}

**GUIs:**

There is currently only the window-based ClickGUI (which you can open by pressing **Right CTRL**).

**Note:** If you can't open the ClickGUI by pressing Right CTRL, try using the following command (in the Minecraft chat): <code>.binds&nbsp;reset</code>

[Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator) and TabGUI will be added back in later pre-releases.
