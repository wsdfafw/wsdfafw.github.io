## Changelog

- This version of Wurst is available for Minecraft 1.15.1-pre1, 1.15, 1.15-pre7, 1.15-pre6, 1.15-pre5, 1.15-pre4, 1.15-pre3 and 1.14.4.

- Fixed [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator) not responding to mouse scrolling.

- Jesus is back! I mean he's still dead, but the hack is back.

- Added a checkbox to toggle Jesus's NoCheat+ bypass, as it seems that using the bypass will now slow down your movement. If anyone knows a fix for this, let me know!

- `.tp` is back!

- [`.rename`](https://wurst.wiki/cmd/rename) is back!

- `.give` is back!

## Working Features

Please keep in mind that this is just a pre-release! It doesn't (yet) have all of the features of Wurst 7, or all of the features of Wurst 6. Only the following features are included in this version:

{% include update/features.html hacks=site.data.hacks.since_v7_0pre18 commands=site.data.commands.since_v7_0pre18 other=site.data.other_features.since_v7_0pre16 %}

### GUIs:

- Window-based ClickGUI (which you can open by pressing **Right CTRL**).

- [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator) (which you can open by pressing **Right Shift**).

- TabGUI will be added back in later pre-releases.

**WARNING:** Do NOT use OptiFine version `HD U F4`, it has a bug that breaks X-Ray. Use version `HD U F3` instead.
