- Clean Up is back!

- `.enchant` is back! (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/MaxCoding3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">@MaxCoding3</a>)

- [`.friends`](https://wurst.wiki/cmd/friends) is back! (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Mersid" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">@Mersid</a>)

- Added [`.friends remove-all`](https://wurst.wiki/cmd/friends).

- The "Click Friends" setting in the Wurst Options is back!

- Added a "Middle click friends" checkbox to [`.friends`](https://wurst.wiki/cmd/friends) (you can only see this by using [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator)). Does the same thing as the button in the Wurst Options.

- Moved the "Wurst Logo" and "HackList" buttons to the top of the "UI Settings" window.

- Fixed the ClickGUI not responding to mouse scrolling.

## Working Features
