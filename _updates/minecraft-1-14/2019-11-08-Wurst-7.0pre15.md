## 更新日志

- This version of Wurst is available for Minecraft 1.14.4 and 19w45a.

- NoWeb is back!

- `.vclip` is back!

- Added an "Alt Manager" button to the main menu. This button is currently grayed out and says "(NYI)" because Alt Manager is **n**ot **y**et **i**mplemented.

- Fixed the Zoom Manager not properly changing the Zoom keybind.

- Fixed ClickGUI and [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator) not rendering properly in snapshot versions.

I know it's not much. This wasn't a very productive week for me. Sorry about that.

## Working Features

Please keep in mind that this is just a pre-release! It doesn't (yet) have all of the features of Wurst 7, or all of the features of Wurst 6. Only the following features are included in this version:

{% include update/features.html hacks=site.data.hacks.since_v7_0pre15 commands=site.data.commands.since_v7_0pre15 other=site.data.other_features.since_v7_0pre14 %}

### GUIs:

- Window-based ClickGUI (which you can open by pressing **Right CTRL**).

- [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator) (which you can open by pressing **Right Shift**).

- TabGUI will be added back in later pre-releases.

**WARNING:** Do not use OptiFine version `HD U F4`, it has a bug that breaks X-Ray. Use version `HD U F3` instead.
