## 更新日志

- [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator) is back!

- `.copyitem` is back!

- The Wurst logo and enabled hacks list are back!

- Added a "HackList" feature in Navigator that allows you to customize / disable the list of enabled hacks.

- Added a "WurstLogo" feature in Navigator that allows you to disable the Wurst logo in the top left corner. (The Logo will still show up if you use an outdated version of Wurst)

- Added a button to the "UI Settings" window in ClickGUI to access the WurstLogo settings.

- Added a button to the "UI Settings" window in ClickGUI to access the HackList settings.

- Fixed an issue where the [default keybinds](https://wurst.wiki/keybinds#default_keybinds) would not be created if the `.minecraft/wurst` folder contained a `keybinds.json` file from an older version.

## Working Features

Since this is an early pre-release, it does not yet have all of the features of Wurst 7.0.

### GUIs:

- Window-based ClickGUI (which you can open by pressing **Right CTRL**).

- [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator) (which you can open by pressing **Right Shift**).

- TabGUI will be added back in later pre-releases.
