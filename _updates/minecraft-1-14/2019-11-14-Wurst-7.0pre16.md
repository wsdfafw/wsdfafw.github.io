## Changelog

- This version of Wurst is available for Minecraft 1.14.4, 19w45b, 19w46a and 19w46b.

- ScaffoldWalk is back!

- Fixed ScaffoldWalk placing sand in places where it would fall.

- AutoSign is back!

- Blink is back!

- `.blink` is also back!

- `.blink cancel` will now show an error message if Blink is already turned off.

- Panic is back!

- Timer is back!

- The Alt Manager button will now open the "Direct Login" screen. The "Steal Skin" and "Open Skin Folder" buttons are currently broken and the rest of Alt Manager is still not done.

  Also, please remember that Mojang's servers can temporarily shadowban your IP address if you login too often within a short time (sometimes 2-3 logins within a few minutes can be enough!).

  When this happens, they will always claim that your password is wrong, even if it isn't. This will typically last for a few hours, sometimes even 24 hours, but never more than that.

- Fixed NoWeb breaking NoFall.

## Working Features

Please keep in mind that this is just a pre-release! It doesn't (yet) have all of the features of Wurst 7, or all of the features of Wurst 6. Only the following features are included in this version:

### GUIs:

- Window-based ClickGUI (which you can open by pressing **Right CTRL**).

- [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator) (which you can open by pressing **Right Shift**).

- TabGUI will be added back in later pre-releases.
