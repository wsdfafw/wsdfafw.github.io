## Changelog

- Added [MobSpawnESP](https://wurst.wiki/mobspawnesp): Highlights areas where mobs can spawn. A yellow cross indicates that mobs can spawn at night, while a red one means that mobs can spawn at any time. (MC 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.11 OF, 1.12 & 1.12 OF)

- [AntiSpam](https://wurst.wiki/antispam) can now block and count long messages correctly, even if the "spam counter" ends up on two lines.

- Excavator will now prioritize blocks at higher altitudes. This allows it to work in survival mode without having to use the [Flight hack](https://wurst.wiki/flight).

- Fixed Excavator ignoring tall grass, flowers, etc.
