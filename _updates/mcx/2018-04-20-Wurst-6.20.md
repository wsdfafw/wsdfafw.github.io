## 更新日志

- Improved the GUI of ForceOP.

- Improved the error message that ForceOP displays if all login attempts fail.

- Added a "Filter flying" setting to [Killaura](https://wurst.wiki/killaura) so you can filter out flying bots from Watchdog, etc.

- Increased the maximum value of [Killaura](https://wurst.wiki/killaura) "Range" setting to 10 blocks.

- Added a "Priority" setting to [Killaura](https://wurst.wiki/killaura) so you can choose to prioritize targets by angle, by distance or by health.

- Fixed [PlayerESP](https://wurst.wiki/playeresp) Tracers not rendering in blue for players that are on your friends list.

- AutoArmor can now consider the Protection enchantment when calculating armor strength. (optional)

- AutoArmor will no longer try to swap armor pieces while the player is moving (though you can re-enable this behavior in the settings).

- AutoArmor will now prefer armor pieces of better materials, even if the number of defense points is the same.

- AutoArmor will no longer swap armor pieces in a predictable order.

- AutoArmor's delay between swapping pieces of armor can now be configured through a slider - or be disabled altogether by setting the slider to 0.

## Update: Wurst 6.20.1

- Fixed some compatibility issues with 1.12.2 servers. (MC 1.12 & 1.12 OF)

## Update: Wurst 6.20.2

- Fixed a crash when SpeedNuker's mode cannot be loaded from the settings file.
