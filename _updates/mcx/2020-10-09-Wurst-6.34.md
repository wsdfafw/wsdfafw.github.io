This version of the Wurst Hacked Client is available for Minecraft 1.12 - 1.12.2 and Minecraft 1.8 - 1.8.9, both with and without OptiFine integration.

## 更新日志

- **Wurst 7's entity filters are finally coming to Wurst 6.** This allows you to select exactly what kinds of entities each hack should target directly in the settings.

- **Killaura and other combat hacks can now attack end crystals automatically.** Other clients would call this a "CrystalAura" or "AutoCrystal", but instead of adding a separate cheat, we have decided to add this functionality to all of Wurst's existing combat mods. This allows you to not only turn your [Killaura](https://wurst.wiki/killaura) into a [CrystalAura](https://wurst.wiki/crystalaura), but you can also turn your [BowAimbot](https://wurst.wiki/bowaimbot) into a CrystalAimbot, turn your FightBot into a CrystalBot, and so on, making Wurst one of the most versatile crystal PVP hacked client that Minecraft has ever seen. Our [Wurst 7.5](/updates/wurst-7-5/) users already love this feature and we hope that you will enjoy it just as much!

- [BowAimbot](https://wurst.wiki/bowaimbot) will now "lock" its target again, just like it did in older versions. It will now longer randomly switch to a different target when you least expect it.

- Added a "Predict movement" slider to [BowAimbot](https://wurst.wiki/bowaimbot): Controls the strength of BowAimbot's movement prediction algorithm. This value is now set to 20% by default (was locked to 100% before the slider existed).

- Improved [Killaura](https://wurst.wiki/killaura)'s search tags. This makes it easier to find Killaura through the search bar in [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator).

- Fixed chat messages with a ClickEvent tag being able to trigger Wurst commands. (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ThisTestUser" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ThisTestUser</a>!)
