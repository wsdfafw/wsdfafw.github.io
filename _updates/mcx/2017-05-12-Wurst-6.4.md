## 更新日志

- Improved [`.binds`](https://wurst.wiki/cmd/binds) so that it can actually manage your keybinds and not just list them.

- The Keybind Manager will now allow you to make keybinds that run the same command multiple times.

- When binding a key to multiple commands, the Keybind Manager will now remember the order in which you specified the commands.

- You can now make keybinds that make keybinds that make keybinds that... you get the idea.

- Added a "Shader compatibility mode" setting to Fullbright. (MC 1.11 OF)

- Added a "Pause in mid-air" checkbox to Regen.

- Improved ScaffoldWalk.

- Improved ClickAura.

- Improved TP-Aura.

- Added "Block water slowness", "Block soul sand slowness" and "Block item slowness" checkboxes to NoSlowdown.

- NoSlowdown will now bypass NoCheat+ as long as "Block water slowness" is disabled.

- Renamed Bypass Levels to YesCheat+ Profiles.

- Simplified [Killaura](https://wurst.wiki/killaura)'s settings.

- Fixed [X-Ray](https://wurst.wiki/x-ray) not rendering properly when using shaders. (MC 1.11 OF)
