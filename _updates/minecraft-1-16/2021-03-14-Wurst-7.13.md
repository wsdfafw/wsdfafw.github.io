This version of the Wurst Hacked Client is available for Minecraft 1.16.5, as well as snapshots 21w11a, 21w10a, 21w08a/b and 21w05a/b.

**WARNING:** The 21w10a and 21w11a versions are very broken and will crash instantly if you activate the wrong hacks. These versions also have many graphical glitches, which could potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy. It is highly recommended to turn off all hacks before using these versions. Some usable hacks are ClickGUI, Killaura, Nuker, X-Ray and Freecam. Most other hacks are untested and you will have to find out for yourself which ones still work.

**Note:** The 21w08a version also works with 21w08b and the 21w05a version also works with 21w05b.

## Changelog

- Added [PortalGUI](https://wurst.wiki/portalgui): Allows you to open GUIs in portals. (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ThisTestUser" target="_blank">ThisTestUser</a>!)

- Added a "Range" slider to Reach.

- Added NoBackground: Removes the dark background behind inventories. (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/flestr" target="_blank">flestr</a>!)

- Improved [AutoFarm](https://wurst.wiki/autofarm)'s speed when the ["Replant" checkbox](https://wurst.wiki/autofarm#replant) is checked.

- [X-Ray](https://wurst.wiki/x-ray) will now show a warning when OptiFine or Sodium is installed.

- Fixed [MobSpawnESP](https://wurst.wiki/mobspawnesp) glitching out when extremely far from spawn.

- Fixed [a crash](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/322) when using [VanillaSpoof](https://wurst.wiki/vanillaspoof) with certain Fabric API versions.

- Fixed all of the "Filter flying" settings doing the opposite of what they should do.

- Fixed a visual glitch when editing BlockList settings (e.g. [X-Ray](https://wurst.wiki/x-ray)'s list of ores).

- Fixed KillauraLegit not facing its target properly.
