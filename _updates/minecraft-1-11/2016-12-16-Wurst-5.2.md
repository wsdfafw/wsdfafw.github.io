## Changelog

- Improved reliability and performance of [AntiSpam](https://wurst.wiki/antispam).

  - It will now run in the same thread as the chat itself, meaning that every new message will now be checked by AntiSpam _before_ being added to the chat.

  - It can now reliably keep up with any new messages, regardless of how quickly they are added to the chat.

  - Rather than cleaning up the entire chat every time a new message is added, it will now only clean up duplicates of that message.

- Improved AutoArmor.

  - It will now work in both survival and creative mode.

  - It will now update once per second rather than once every 3 seconds.

- Renamed KillerPotion to KillPotion.

- Renamed CrashItem to CrashTag.

- Improved CrashTag, KillPotion and TrollPotion.

- Fixed some settings not loading correctly.

- Fixed AutoFish not catching anything.

- Fixed Tracers disabling the view bobbing completely.

- Fixed CMD-Block, `.copyitem`, CrashChest and `.give` not giving items.

- Fixed Clean Up keeping 1.10 servers and removing the 1.11 ones.

- Fixed KillPotion and TrollPotion not giving potions.

- Removed [ArenaBrawl](https://wurst.wiki/arenabrawl).
