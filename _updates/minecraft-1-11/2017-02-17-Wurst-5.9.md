## Changelog

- [ChestESP](https://wurst.wiki/chestesp)'s memory of previously opened chests is no longer limited by the render distance.

- [PlayerESP](https://wurst.wiki/playeresp) and Tracers will no longer render on sleeping players and invisible players if those are disabled in the Target settings.

- MobESP will no longer render on invisible mobs if those are disabled in the Target settings.

- [PlayerESP](https://wurst.wiki/playeresp), MobESP, ItemESP and Tracers will now use interpolation for smoother rendering.

- You can now remove a server from the multiplayer screen by pressing the <kbd>delete</kbd> key. This method bypasses the usual "Are you sure?" dialog, allowing you to quickly remove a bunch of servers without having to use Clean Up.

- Updated links in the Wurst Options.

- Improved the colors of sliders.

- Fixed locked checkboxes, sliders and color selectors not updating properly (a.k.a. [Killaura](https://wurst.wiki/killaura) ignoring the Target settings).

- Fixed FOV calculations (a.k.a. [Killaura](https://wurst.wiki/killaura) sometimes not attacking anything).

- Wurstâ€™s Google Analytics integration will no longer keep track of protocol issues, as all of those issues have now been fixed.
