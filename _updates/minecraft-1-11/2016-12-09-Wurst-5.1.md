## Changelog

- Follow and [AntiAFK](https://wurst.wiki/antiafk) will now use the new AI.

- Follow now has a "Distance" slider that determines how closely it will follow the entity.

  - If the distance between the player and the entity is more than the specified value, the AI will try to get closer to it.

  - If it cannot get close enough to be within the specified distance, it will try to get as close as possible.

  - If it is closer than the specified distance, it will do nothing.

  - The slider ranges from 1 to 12. The default value is 1. Distance is measured in blocks.

  - Lower distance values make Follow more annoying when used against a player. A distance of 1 is recommended for trolling.

- The AI will now dynamically update its path whenever obstacles appear or the player's abilities change.

- The PathFinder will no longer try to jump without a good reason.

  - It will only consider jumping as an option if the jump leads directly to the goal or one of the blocks next to its current position is safe to stand on.

  - Removing useless jumps from the path significantly improves PathFinder's performance and thereby increases its range.

  - One of our own tests showed a 1250x increase in performance. Computation time went down from ~50ms to ~0.04ms.

  - Results may vary depending on the terrain, but the biggest improvement can be seen on big open areas with lots of possible jumps.

  - This does not affect performance when flying, but flying was already pretty fast.

- The AI will no longer get stuck at one-block-holes like this one:

- Clicking on the "screenshot saved" message after taking a screenshot will now open the screenshots folder instead of opening the screenshot itself.

  This allows you to not only view the screenshot, but also to edited it, copy it, and post it on social media without having to manually find that damn folder every time!

- The AI will no longer get stuck when falling more than a few blocks down.

- The AI will no longer try to jump over fences.

- The AI will no longer get stuck in the ceiling when flying.

- Follow will no longer turn off every time the target teleports. If the target is still within the players render distance after teleporting, it will stay enabled and keep following the target.

- Fixed EntityUtils using an outdated entity list sometimes. (This caused [MultiAura](https://wurst.wiki/multiaura), Follow and some other things to not target some entities.)
