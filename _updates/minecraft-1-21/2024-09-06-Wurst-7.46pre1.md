## Changelog

- Added a "Shape" setting to Nuker, NukerLegit and SpeedNuker. Allows you to break blocks around you in a cube shape (kind of like Tunneller) instead of the default sphere shape. Note that the cube shape works best at low range values like 1-3, since you need to be able to reach the corners. ([#379](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/379))

- Moved the "Flat" option in Nuker's, NukerLegit's, and SpeedNuker's "Mode" setting to a dedicated "Flat mode" checkbox. This allows you to combine Flat mode with other modes like ID.

- Refactored how Nuker, NukerLegit, SpeedNuker, Kaboom and AutoFarm work.

- Nuker, NukerLegit, and SpeedNuker no longer change their name in HackList based on which mode they are in. For example, `IDNukerLegit [coal_ore]` will now be displayed as `NukerLegit [ID:coal_ore]`. This also means the alphabetic sorting of these HackList entries is no longer wrong.

- Nuker will now prioritize blocks that you have line of sight to over blocks that are obstructed. When mining, this means Nuker is more likely to select the ore that you expected, rather than going after some other ore patch behind a wall that is technically closer.

- Fixed NukerLegit getting stuck staring at a block without mining it when you open your inventory.

- Increased NukerLegit's maximum range to 4.5.

- Fixed BlockComponents (like Nuker's ID setting) rendering above other ClickGUI windows that are supposed to be in front of it.

- Added checkboxes to Kaboom that allow you to turn off the explosion sound and particles.

- Updated Kaboom's description and added descriptions to its settings.

- Fixed AutoMine breaking blocks impossibly fast and turned that bug into an optional feature. There is now a "Super fast mode" checkbox in AutoMine that restores this behavior.

- Added a "Bite mode" setting to AutoFish. Allows you to choose how AutoFish tries to detect bites. Sound mode is the old behavior, where it listens for the bite sound. Entity mode looks directly at the fishing hook's entity update packet, which means you don't need to worry about other people's bites being detected as yours. However, servers can prevent Entity mode from working by sending spoofed packets. ([#1054](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/1054))

- Improved X-Ray's performance when "Only show exposed" is enabled.

- Updated Gradle to v8.10 and Gradle GitHub actions to v4.

- Added support for Fabric Loader JUnit, which makes it possible to automatically test _some_ parts of Wurst. Minecraft is notoriously difficult to write unit tests for and even Mojang struggles with this. I don't expect we'll ever reach 100% coverage, but it still seems useful to have unit tests the few areas where it's easy to add them.

- Added a few initial unit tests for Wurst's rotation logic, used primarily in combat hacks like Killaura. This should help to prevent issues with Wurst turning the wrong way when it tries to face something, which is a bug that often appeared and reappeared in the past.

- Added support for Build Scans, which display a lot of useful debug information every time the Gradle CI GitHub action runs. This can help to troubleshoot issues when the code doesn't compile or when tests are failing, among other things.
