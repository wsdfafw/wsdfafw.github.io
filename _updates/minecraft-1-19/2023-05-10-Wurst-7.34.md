## Changelog

- This update was "released" on May 10, but due to <a href="https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/pr3498h3qkfy" target="_blank">an issue at GitHub</a> the website didn't show it until May 11.

- Added AntiEntityPush: Prevents you from getting pushed when standing near other players and mobs. ([817](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/817) - Thanks to [IUDevman](https://github.com/IUDevman)!)

- Updated [AntiKnockback](https://wurst.wiki/antiknockback)'s description to clarify that it only prevents knockback (i.e. getting pushed when players and mobs attack you).

- Added a "Sneak edge distance" setting to [SafeWalk](https://wurst.wiki/safewalk): Lets you choose how close to the edge you can get before starting to visibly sneak. This can help to make your speedbridging look more legit.

- Fixed Parkour not working properly when walking on boats.

- Fixed Step in Legit Mode not working properly below y=-2.

- Fixed [BowAimbot](https://wurst.wiki/bowaimbot), Excavator, [FeedAura](https://wurst.wiki/feedaura), [Freecam](https://wurst.wiki/freecam), [InstantBunker](https://wurst.wiki/instantbunker), [ItemESP](https://wurst.wiki/itemesp)'s tracer lines, Overlay, and ProphuntESP not rendering correctly when you are millions of blocks away from spawn. ([771](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/771) - Thanks to [ThisTestUser](https://github.com/ThisTestUser)!)

- Fixed the block breaking animation in Overlay and [NukerLegit](https://wurst.wiki/nukerlegit) only playing at 20 FPS.

- [Nuker](https://wurst.wiki/nuker) will no longer prevent you from breaking blocks manually while it's active.

- Removed [PlayerFinder](https://wurst.wiki/playerfinder), as it no longer works in modern Minecraft versions and there doesn't seem to be a way to fix it.
