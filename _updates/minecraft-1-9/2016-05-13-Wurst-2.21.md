## 更新日志

- The [Alt Manager](https://wurst.wiki/altmanager) will no longer log you in multiple times when adding or editing an alt. That means you will no longer get IP-banned from Mojang’s login servers, unless of course you manually log in multiple times.

- Improved the search bar in [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator). It now knows a lot more synonyms for the different hacks. For instance, if you search for "SpeedyGonzales", it will now find [FastBreak](https://wurst.wiki/fastbreak).

- The Alt Manager now supports unchecked alts.

- Double clicking on an alt in the Alt Manager will now do the same thing as selecting it and pressing the “Use” button.

- [FastLadder](https://wurst.wiki/fastladder) will now climb ladders roughly 15% faster (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ThisTestUser" target="_blank">ThisTestUser</a>!).

- Fixed [Killaura](https://wurst.wiki/killaura) not properly bypassing when hitting entities behind the player.

- Fixed the Alt Manager not saving alts for some people.

## Update: Wurst 2.21.1 Changelog

- Fixed [Killaura](https://wurst.wiki/killaura) (and some other auras) doing weird things when entities are outside of your range. [Wurst 3.2](/updates/wurst-3-2/) will have the same fix for Minecraft 1.9.X.

## Update: Wurst 2.21.2 Changelog

- Fixed the Auto-Updater constantly trying to update to Wurst 2.21.1 despite already having it.
