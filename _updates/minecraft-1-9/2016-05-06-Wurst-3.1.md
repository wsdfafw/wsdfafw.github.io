## 更新日志

- You can now bind multiple commands to the same key. In the Keybind Manager, the commands are separated by a semicolon (`;`). In [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator), adding a new keybind to a key that is already bound to something will now add the new command without removing the old one. Removing a keybind through Navigator will now only remove the selected command instead of removing all keybinds of the selected key.

- The [Alt Manager](/wiki/Special_Features/Alt_Manager) will no longer log you in multiple times when adding or editing an alt. That means you will no longer get IP-banned from Mojang's login servers, unless of course you manually log in multiple times.

- Improved the search bar in [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator). It now knows a lot more synonyms for the different hacks. For instance, if you search for "SpeedyGonzales", it will now find FastBreak.

- Added articles on the Wurst Wiki for all features that didn't have one before. Some of them are stub articles and you can help us by expanding them.

- The Alt Manager now supports unchecked alts.

- Double clicking on an alt in the Alt Manager will now do the same thing as selecting it and pressing the "Use" button.

- [FastLadder](https://wurst.wiki/fastladder) will now climb ladders roughly 15% faster (community contribution by ThisTestUser).

- Fixed [Killaura](https://wurst.wiki/killaura) not properly bypassing when hitting entities behind the player.

- Fixed the Alt Manager not saving alts for some people.

- Fixed [Nuker](https://wurst.wiki/nuker) kicking you from the server (community contribution by vovanre)
