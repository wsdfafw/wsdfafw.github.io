## Changelog

- Added NoFog: Removes distance fog from the world. ([#904](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/904) - Thanks to [IUDevman](https://github.com/IUDevman)!)

- Added mcMMO mode to AutoFish: When enabled, AutoFish will automatically switch between different fishing spots, completely bypassing mcMMO's overfishing mechanic. ([/d/366](https://wurstforum.net/d/366))

- When starting AutoFish's mcMMO mode, you will need to manually record a few fishing spots for it to use. You will see instructions in chat guiding you through this process. After that, AutoFish is completely autonomous.

- Added multiple new settings related to AutoFish's mcMMO mode:

- "mcMMO range" and "mcMMO limit" match the "MoveRange" and "OverFishLimit" settings in mcMMO's config file, so you can bypass the plugin even on a server with non-default settings.

- "mcMMO range bug" exploits a bug in mcMMO's range calculation - if they fix it in the future, just uncheck this box and you can keep using AutoFish.

- Expanded AutoFish's debug draw with mcMMO mode-related information. You can see each recorded fishing spot and the range of mcMMO's overfishing detection.

- Improved the "See-through mode" setting in NameTags: It no longer makes the nametags hard to read behind transparent blocks. ([#798](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/798) - Thanks to [ThisTestUser](https://github.com/ThisTestUser)!)

- Renamed the "Force nametags" setting in NameTags to "Always show player names".

- Added a "Scale" slider to NameTags, allowing you to make the nametags larger or smaller.

- Added an "Always show named mobs" setting to NameTags: When enabled, the nametags of named mobs will be visible even when you are not looking directly at them. ([#798](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/798) - Thanks to [ThisTestUser](https://github.com/ThisTestUser)!)

- Added a "Jump while sneaking" setting to Parkour: When enabled, Parkour will automatically make you jump even if you are sneaking. ([#456](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/456))

- Added an "Omnidirectional Sprint" setting to AutoSprint: When enabled, AutoSprint will allow you to sprint in all directions, even backwards. ([#916](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/916) - Thanks to [ThisTestUser](https://github.com/ThisTestUser)!)

- If both AutoFish and AutoEat are enabled, AutoFish will now wait for AutoEat to finish eating instead of interrupting it and getting stuck.

- If AutoFish accidentally hooks a mob, it will now immediately reel in the fishing rod and cast it again.

- Fixed Trajectories generating incorrect predictions when aiming a fishing rod at water. The predicted trajectory will now stop at the water surface instead of going through it.
