## Changelog since v7.42pre1

- Added an "Aim while blocking" setting to AimAssist. By default, AimAssist will no longer aim when you are blocking. ([#947](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/947))

- Improved the description of TriggerBot's "Attack while blocking" setting.

- Searching for "AutoAttack" or "AutoClicker" will now find TriggerBot.

- Fixed TriggerBot's swing animation looking slightly different than a normal attack in vanilla. ([#988](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/988))
