## Changelog

- Fixed a false positive from BitDefender and some lesser known antivirus programs.  ([before](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/60456d19ba513e15599d5ccb22eaf1409b76af2fe4372c3f2c180c9e0bc49583) / [after](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/41e6c72b588d5befbcba4ddf7a2e8a9e88c3b68a6d720436e4fadc54f86c10dc))

It seems that the antivirus AI overlords suddenly decided that they don't like a certain part of AutoBuild that has been in the codebase for many years. As a result, many Wurst releases are now falsely flagged as trojans.

For now, I'm releasing a new version that does this one part of AutoBuild in a [slightly different way](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/commit/97d1225f72feb3e2f945884edd6769320b0c8c19), so that BitDefender will stop complaining about it. <del>But for a more long-term solution, let's all [report this issue to BitDefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/consumer/support/answer/29358/) so they'll fix the false positive on their end too.</del> <b>Update:</b> BitDefender seems to have removed the false positive.
