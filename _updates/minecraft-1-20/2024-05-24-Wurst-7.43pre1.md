## Changelog

- AutoTool's "Repair mode" option will now move the damaged tool out of your hotbar to ensure it doesn't break.

- Added a "Totems" slider to AutoLeave that optionally prevents it from leaving the server while you still have enough totems of undying to stay alive. ([#826](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/826))

- Using AutoLeave in singleplayer will now leave the world as one would expect.

- If AutoLeave is paused because you're in creative mode, it will now say so in the HackList.

- AutoTotem can now take totems from armor slots.

- Sliders that accept decimal values will now display whole numbers like "1" instead of "1.0".

- Made AutoTool's "Switch back" option less eager to switch back as soon as possible. Now it will wait until you stop looking at blocks.

- AutoMine will now swing your hand on the client side.

- Fixed AutoTotem's "Health" slider saying "1 hearts" instead of "1 heart".

- Fixed AutoMine slightly changing the way you are facing.

- Fixed Overlay not rendering when you are using AutoMine.

- Fixed Excavator trying to break Bedrock in survival mode. ([#675](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/675))

- Fixed Excavator fighting against AutoEat if both are enabled and you get hungry while excavating. ([#316](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/316))

- Fixed Excavator sometimes mining very slowly when AutoTool is enabled.

- Removed AutoLeave's "TP" mode, as this kind of teleport packet no longer causes modern servers to kick you.
