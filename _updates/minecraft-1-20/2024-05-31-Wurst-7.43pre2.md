## Changelog since v7.43pre1

- TriggerBot, AimAssist, and KillauraLegit, with their default settings, will now bypass Vulcan anti-cheat (versions 2.8.6 and 2.8.8 tested).

  **Update:** A reader asked me if the above hacks can also bypass Vulcan if you set their attack range all the way up to 6 blocks. I can confirm that both TriggerBot and AimAssist do indeed bypass even at 6 blocks (and even if you use both at the same time). KillauraLegit's range slider normally maxes out at 4.25 in the UI, but it too works fine if you force the slider to 6.

- Added a "Speed randomization" slider to TriggerBot, Killaura, and KillauraLegit, which helps you bypass anti-cheat plugins by varying the delay between attacks. It's set to +/-100ms by default, which is enough to bypass Vulcan.

- Even without the speed randomization, the attacks of TriggerBot, Killaura, and KillauraLegit are now much harder for anti-cheat plugins to detect.

- The client-side aiming of AimAssist and KillauraLegit will now look smooth on your screen even if you're manually moving your mouse at the same time.

- Even when you aren't moving your mouse, the client-side aiming of AimAssist and KillauraLegit is now much harder for anti-cheat plugins to detect.

- Added a "Show wait time" checkbox to AntiAFK (checked by default), which displays the remaining time until AntiAFK will make the player move again.

- Updated the Simplified Chinese translations ([#999](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/999))

- Fixed a crash when trying to login to an alt while you don't have an internet connection.

- Fixed AltManager lagging and spamming the log file if it's opened while you don't have an internet connection. ([#1000](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/1000))

- Fixed AntiAFK getting stuck in an infinite loop (usually jumping) if the player is forced out of the predicted path and can't get back.

- Fixed AntiAFK waiting longer than it should.

- Fixed AntiAFK's drowning protection not working.

- Even when you aren't moving your mouse, the client-side aiming of AimAssist and KillauraLegit is now much harder for anti-cheat plugins to detect.

- AutoTool's "Repair mode" option will now move the damaged tool out of your hotbar to ensure it doesn't break.

- Added a "Totems" slider to AutoLeave that optionally prevents it from leaving the server while you still have enough totems of undying to stay alive. ([#826](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/826))

- Using AutoLeave in singleplayer will now leave the world as one would expect.

- If AutoLeave is paused because you're in creative mode, it will now say so in the HackList.

- AutoTotem can now take totems from armor slots.

- Sliders that accept decimal values will now display whole numbers like "1" instead of "1.0".

- Made AutoTool's "Switch back" option less eager to switch back as soon as possible. Now it will wait until you stop looking at blocks.

- Added a "Show wait time" checkbox to AntiAFK (checked by default), which displays the remaining time until AntiAFK will make the player move again.

- Fixed Excavator trying to break Bedrock in survival mode. ([#675](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/675))

- Fixed Excavator fighting against AutoEat if both are enabled and you get hungry while excavating. ([#316](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/316))

- Fixed Excavator sometimes mining very slowly when AutoTool is enabled.

- Removed AutoLeave's "TP" mode, as this kind of teleport packet no longer causes modern servers to kick you.

- Fixed a crash when trying to login to an alt while you don't have an internet connection.

- Fixed AltManager lagging and spamming the log file if it's opened while you don't have an internet connection. ([#1000](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/1000))

- Fixed AntiAFK getting stuck in an infinite loop (usually jumping) if the player is forced out of the predicted path and can't get back.
