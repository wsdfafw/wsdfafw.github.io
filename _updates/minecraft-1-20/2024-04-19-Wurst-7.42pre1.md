## Changelog

- Added a "Swing hand" setting to many different hacks: AnchorAura, CrystalAura, FightBot, Killaura, KillauraLegit, MultiAura, Protect, TriggerBot, TP-Aura.

- For KillauraLegit, the hand swing can't be turned off completely, as that wouldn't be legit.

- Fixed the "Filter hostile mobs" setting also filtering out neutral mobs.

- Fixed VanillaSpoof not working correctly. ([#948](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/948))

- Fixed the up/down arrows not cycling through your recent .commands like they do with /commands.
