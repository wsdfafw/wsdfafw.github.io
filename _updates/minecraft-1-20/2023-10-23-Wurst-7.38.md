## Changelog

- [ChestESP](https://wurst.wiki/chestesp) now supports [decorated pots](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Decorated_Pot) and [crafters](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Crafter) in Minecraft 23w42a and later versions.

- [X-Ray](https://wurst.wiki/x-ray) now shows decorated pots and crafters by default in Minecraft 23w42a and later versions. (Remember to reset your X-Ray list when updating from an older version.)

- Replaced the "Filter animals" setting with "Filter passive mobs". This new filter will no longer include wolves, bees, polar bears, and pufferfish, since they are not really passive. It's otherwise identical to the old animal filter.

- Replaced the "Filter monsters" setting with "Filter hostile mobs". This new filter will no longer include endermen, non-brute piglins, and zombified piglins, since they are not really hostile. It's otherwise identical to the old monster filter.

- Added a "Filter neutral mobs" setting. This new filter has a third option that detects when the neutral mobs are aggressive and filters them out only while they're peaceful.

- Replaced the "Filter pigmen" setting with "Filter zombie piglins". This new filter has the same third option to detect when the zombified piglins are aggressive.

- Added a "Filter piglins" setting to filter out regular piglins (except for brutes). This filter has the same third option to detect when the piglins are aggressive.

- Added a third option to the "Filter endermen" setting to detect when they are aggressive.

- Added a "Filter bats" setting that filters out bats and any other ambient mobs that might be added by other mods.

- Added a "Filter passive water mobs" setting that filters out most fish, as well as squids, dolphins and axolotls. Dangerous aquatic mobs like guardians, drowned, and pufferfish are not included.

- The "Filter babies" setting now includes tadpoles.

- Updated the "Filter babies" setting's description to clarify that it doesn't affect baby zombies and other hostile baby mobs.

- The "Filter golems" setting no longer includes shulkers, since nobody other than Mojang thinks of shulkers as a type of golem.

- Added a separate "Filter shulkers" setting.

- Renamed the "Filter traders" setting to "Filter villagers".

- Added a "Filter zombie villagers" setting.

- Added a "Filter slimes" setting (does not include magma cubes).

- Added more [MobESP](https://wurst.wiki/mobesp) settings to filter out hostile mobs, neutral mobs, passive mobs, passive water mobs, bats, slimes, pets, villagers, zombie villagers, golems, piglins, zombie piglins, endermen, shulkers, allays, and armor stands.

- MobESP can now show armor stands, if enabled in the settings.

- [AimAssist](https://wurst.wiki/aimassist) and [TriggerBot](https://wurst.wiki/triggerbot) are now compatible with each other.

- Added a "Check line of sight" setting to AimAssist. When enabled, AimAssist will only aim at entities that you have line of sight to. ([#886](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/886) - Thanks to [TejasLamba2006](https://github.com/TejasLamba2006)!)

- Fixed the "Filter sleeping" setting not working correctly in Hypixel minigames. ([#869](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/869) - Thanks to [PeriodicSeizures](https://github.com/PeriodicSeizures)!)

- Updated the Japanese translations ([#874](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/874) - Thanks to [sabaadmin](https://github.com/sabaadmin)!)

- Fixed [KillauraLegit](https://wurst.wiki/killauralegit) attacking through blocks.

- Fixed tracers not rendering correctly when the player is in a vehicle. ([#830](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/830) - Thanks to [ThisTestUser](https://github.com/ThisTestUser)!)

- Fixed [Dolphin](https://wurst.wiki/dolphin) and [Fish](https://wurst.wiki/fish) affecting the player's movement on land if it's raining. ([#799](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/799) - Thanks to [ThisTestUser](https://github.com/ThisTestUser)!)

- Fixed [AntiBlind](https://wurst.wiki/antiblind) not preventing the darkness effect from changing the sky color if the player also has the night vision effect active at the same time. ([#825](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/825) - Thanks to [ThisTestUser](https://github.com/ThisTestUser)!)
