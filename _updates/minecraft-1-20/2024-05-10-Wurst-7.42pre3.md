## Changelog since v7.42pre2

- Added `sculk_sensor`, `sculk_shrieker`, `sculk_catalyst`, and `budding_amethyst` to X-Ray's default list of ores. (Remember to reset your X-Ray list when updating from an older version.)

- From now on, BlockListSettings, ItemListSettings, and BookOffersSettings that are left at their default values (like X-Ray's list of ores for many people) will be updated automatically when the default list changes. So in future updates, you won't have to reset your X-Ray list anymore.

- BonemealAura can now also use bone meal from your offhand.

- Tillaura can now also use a hoe in your offhand.

- Improved how BonemealAura and Tillaura right click on blocks to be more reliable and consistent with vanilla.

- Added "Wait time" and "Wait time randomization" sliders to AntiAFK. ([#982](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/982))

- Added "AI range" and "Non-AI range" sliders to AntiAFK, which determine how far AntiAFK can move the player away from the starting position when "Use AI" is enabled or disabled, respectively.

- Added a description to AntiAFK's "Use AI" setting.

- Searching for "SneakSafety", "SpeedBridge", or "BridgeHelper" will now find SafeWalk.

- Searching for "Fertilizer" or "AutoBonemeal" will now find BonemealAura.

- Fixed the "Filter passive mobs" and "Filter babies" settings also filtering out hoglins.

- FeedAura's "Filter horse-like animals" setting is now disabled by default, as MC-233276 (the bug that caused horses to consume infinite food) has been fixed.

- Updated AntiWaterPush for better compatibility with other mods. This _should_ fix an incompatibility with Sinytra Connector, but I can't test it right now because Sinytra Connector only supports Minecraft 1.20.1 and this build is for 1.20.6. ([#924](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/924))

- Fixed the LSD hack not working in Minecraft 1.20.5/6.

- Fixed FastBreak slowing down significantly after you click on an unbreakable block. ([#962](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/962))

## Changelog since v7.41.2

- Added a "Swing hand" setting to many different hacks: AnchorAura, CrystalAura, FightBot, Killaura, KillauraLegit, MultiAura, Protect, TriggerBot, TP-Aura.

- For KillauraLegit, the hand swing can't be turned off completely, as that wouldn't be legit.

- Added an "Aim while blocking" setting to AimAssist. By default, AimAssist will no longer aim when you are blocking. ([#947](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/947))

- Added `sculk_sensor`, `sculk_shrieker`, `sculk_catalyst`, and `budding_amethyst` to X-Ray's default list of ores. (Remember to reset your X-Ray list when updating from an older version.)

- From now on, BlockListSettings, ItemListSettings, and BookOffersSettings that are left at their default values (like X-Ray's list of ores for many people) will be updated automatically when the default list changes. So in future updates, you won't have to reset your X-Ray list anymore.

- BonemealAura can now also use bone meal from your offhand.

- Tillaura can now also use a hoe in your offhand.

- Improved how BonemealAura and Tillaura right click on blocks to be more reliable and consistent with vanilla.

- Added "Wait time" and "Wait time randomization" sliders to AntiAFK. ([#982](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/982))

- Added "AI range" and "Non-AI range" sliders to AntiAFK, which determine how far AntiAFK can move the player away from the starting position when "Use AI" is enabled or disabled, respectively.

- Added a description to AntiAFK's "Use AI" setting.

- Improved the description of TriggerBot's "Attack while blocking" setting.

- Searching for "AutoAttack" or "AutoClicker" will now find TriggerBot.

- Searching for "SneakSafety", "SpeedBridge", or "BridgeHelper" will now find SafeWalk.

- Searching for "Fertilizer" or "AutoBonemeal" will now find BonemealAura.

- Fixed TriggerBot's swing animation looking slightly different than a normal attack in vanilla. ([#988](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/988))

  (This GIF is intentionally slowed down.)

- Fixed the "Filter hostile mobs" setting also filtering out neutral mobs.

- Fixed the "Filter passive mobs" and "Filter babies" settings also filtering out hoglins.

- FeedAura's "Filter horse-like animals" setting is now disabled by default, as MC-233276 (the bug that caused horses to consume infinite food) has been fixed.

- Updated AntiWaterPush for better compatibility with other mods. May or may not fix an incompatibility with Sinytra Connector in Minecraft 1.20.1. ([#924](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/924))

- Fixed VanillaSpoof not working correctly. ([#948](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/948))

- Fixed the up/down arrows not cycling through your recent .commands like they do with /commands.

- Fixed a crash when trying to load a keybind profile that doesn't end in `.json`. ([#951](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/issues/951))

- Fixed a division by zero error leading to "Invalid entity rotation" entries in the logs.

- Fixed the LSD hack not working in Minecraft 1.20.5/6.

- Fixed FastBreak slowing down significantly after you click on an unbreakable block. ([#962](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/962))
