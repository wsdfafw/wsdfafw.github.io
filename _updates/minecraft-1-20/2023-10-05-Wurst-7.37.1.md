## Changelog

- Added support for the XDG base directory standard. ([#876](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7/pull/876) - Thanks to [DutchO7](https://github.com/DutchO7)!)

- Made the zoom keybind a bit more stealthy: Instead of saying "key.wurst.zoom" in a separate "Zoom" category, it's now listed as "Zoom" under the vanilla "Miscellaneous" category. This should help to make this entry stand out less from existing vanilla keybinds.

- AirPlace no longer causes issues when fishing and is now compatible with AutoFish.

- Fixed a lot of weird issues that used to happen when AirPlace is enabled.

- Fixed the zoom stopping you from scrolling through the items in your hotbar even when the "Use Mouse Wheel" option is disabled.

- Fixed the Zoom Manager screen showing the zoom keybind in all lowercase.

- Fixed ".toomanyhax list-profiles" not working correctly. ([/d/201](https://wurstforum.net/d/201) - Thanks to [ZANX3Y](https://github.com/ZANX3Y)!)

- Fixed MobSpawnESP and NewChunks not updating correctly when you move to a different dimension.

- Fixed a visual glitch in Search, CaveFinder and BaseFinder when moving to a different region.

- Fixed some subtle visual glitches when an entity is about to despawn.

- Fixed the "Server Finder" and "Clean Up" buttons on the server list screen being off by a few pixels.

- Fixed BuildRandom not behaving correctly when "Check held item" is disabled and you have usable items in both hands.

- There have been many more improvements and clean-ups under the hood to keep Wurst running smoothly.
