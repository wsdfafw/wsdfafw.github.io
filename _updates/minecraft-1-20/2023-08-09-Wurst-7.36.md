## Changelog

- Replaced the Fast / Legit Mode dropdown in [BuildRandom](https://wurst.wiki/buildrandom) with a "Range" slider, a "Check line of sight" checkbox, a "Facing" dropdown, a "Swing" dropdown, a "Place while breaking" checkbox and a "Place while riding" checkbox. This lets you control how fast or legit BuildRandom should be much more precisely than before.

- Rewrote BuildRandom's block placing logic, making it more legit in general.

- By default, BuildRandom will no longer build while you are breaking a block or riding a vehicle, since that wouldn't be possible in vanilla Minecraft. You can re-enable the old behavior in the settings.

- Added a "Max attempts" slider to BuildRandom, which lets you control the number of random positions that BuildRandom will try to place a block at in one tick. Higher values speed up the build process at the cost of increased lag.

- Added an "Indicator" checkbox to BuildRandom that lets you turn off the visual indicator showing where BuildRandom is placing blocks.

- Added "OpenAI chat endpoint", "OpenAI legacy endpoint" and "Oobabooga endpoint" settings to [AutoComplete](https://wurst.wiki/autocomplete). Useful if you are using OpenAI through a proxy or hosting oobabooga on a separate machine.

- AutoComplete now supports all of OpenAI's currently available language models.

- Fixed [NoFall](https://wurst.wiki/nofall) not preventing fall damage when flying down with CreativeFlight in survival mode.

- Fixed NoFall sending unnecessary packets when you're falling in creative mode.

- Radar will now display friends in blue.

- Cleaned up some of the code in [AnchorAura](https://wurst.wiki/anchoraura). There shouldn't be any noticeable changes in behavior.

- Added a WikiDataExport button that is only accessible through Navigator. When pressed, it generates a JSON file at `.minecraft/wurst/wiki-data.json`, with information about all the different features and settings in this version of Wurst. As the name suggests, I use this file for the Wurst Wiki, but maybe some of you can find other uses for it.
