## Changelog

- Wurst's AI can now fully understand diagonal walking, fall damage and climbing, making it officially better than Minecraft's zombie AI.

- Wurst's AI can now walk diagonally.

- Wurst's AI can now climb up and down on ladders and vines (previously it could only climb up and only use ladders).

- Wurst's AI will no longer walk on soul sand if walking around it is faster.

- Wurst's AI can now understand that water, lava, ladders, vines and webs reset the player's fall damage.

- Added new arguments to `.path`:

  - `-debug`: Toggles debug mode. When enabled, shows additional information about how the path was found.  
**Note:** If you find a bug in the PathFinder, take a screenshot with debug mode enabled and attach it to the bug report.

  - `-depth`: Toggles depth testing. When disabled, the path will render through walls.

  - `-refresh`: Calculates the last path again. Useful for debugging or if the world has changed since the last calculation.

- `.path` will now spread its calculations over multiple ticks if necessary. This means it will no longer cause a ton of lag while searching for a path, but the searching will take longer.

- <del>When a path leads multiple blocks in the same direction, `.path` will now render one long arrow instead of multiple short ones.</del> This is currently disabled. It was causing issues with diagonal movement.

- Fixed Wurst's AI not finding the shortest path through water.

- Fixed Wurst-Bot not starting.

- Fixed RemoteView disabling itself when enabled.

- Fixed a rendering glitch in [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator).
