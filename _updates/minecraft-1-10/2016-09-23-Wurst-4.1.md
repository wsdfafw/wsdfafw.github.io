## Changelog

- Added NoWalls: Allows you walk through walls.  
  Not all servers support this.

- Added YesCheat+ mode indicator: Displays the current YesCheat+ mode in the ModList. Can be disabled in the YesCheat+ settings.

- Added FightBot settings: Cooldown, Speed, Range, Distance

- Added Parkour: Makes you jump automatically when reaching the edge of a block.  
  Useful for parkours, Jump'n'Runs, etc.

- Improved Jesus: It will now make you sink down when sneaking and will no longer get stuck when used underwater



- Fixed a crash caused by ChestESP

- Fixed a rare crash when processing entities

- Fixed a crash caused by corrupted chat messages  
  Notice: This is a bug in Minecraft itself. This fix only prevents the game from crashing, but the message will still be lost.

- Fixed Step not stepping when Auto-Jump is enabled

- Fixed Step getting stuck at walls taller than 1 block while YesCheat+ is enabled

- Fixed ClickAura always using the [Killaura](https://wurst.wiki/killaura) settings instead of its own ones

- Fixed FightBot ignoring the attack cooldown

- Removed "Jump" mode in Step, as that is now part of vanilla Minecraft
