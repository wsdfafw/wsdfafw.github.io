## Changelog

- Significantly improved PathFinder range and performance.

- `.goto` can now properly use creative mode flight.

- Minecraft's Auto-Jump will no longer mess with `.goto`.

- Added `.goto -path`: Goes to the last position that `.path` was set to.

- Wurst's AI will now ignore any changes made to the player's abilities while path finding is still in progress. (That means it will no longer give you a nonsense path if you run the `.path` command while not flying and then suddenly start flying before it's done.)

- Improved PathFinder algorithm for climbing.

- Fixed Wurst's AI trying to go through non-loaded chunks.

- Fixed Wurst's AI trying to walk over lava in survival mode if Jesus is enabled. (Sure, it works, but it would damage you.)

- Removed GoTo mod. (This used to be a hidden utility mod for the `.goto` command.)

## Notice

This is probably the last update of Wurst for Minecraft 1.10. We will continue the AI improvements in Minecraft 1.11.

## Update: Wurst 4.7.1

- Added a notice about Wurst 5.0 for Minecraft 1.11.
