                    <summary>My antivirus is detecting the Fabric installer as malicious.</summary>
                    <p>
                        This can happen with the Fabric installer "for Windows" (the .exe version), but it's almost certainly a false positive. You can either ignore the warning or use the Universal/.jar version of the Fabric installer, which does not have this problem.

                    <p>
                        This can happen when you don't have Java installed. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv0vPUwitJs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">video on how to install Java</a>.

                    <p>
                        This means your computer is configured to open .jar files with that other program instead of using Java.
                        There is a setting in Windows called "Choose default apps by file type" that lets you change this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alternatively, you can also use "right click" > "open with" to open the file with Java, like so:<br>

                        First make sure that the "Modded" checkbox is enabled. Modded installations like Fabric are invisible without it.

                        If you already had the Minecraft launcher open while you were installing Fabric (Loader), it is possible that you need to restart the Minecraft Launcher to make it "realize" that there is a new installation.

                        If none of that helps, you probably don't have the installation. You can either <a href="#create-profile-automatically">run the Fabric installer again</a>, or <a href="#create-profile-manually">create the installation manually</a>.

                                Okay, let me explain to you how these versions work. If you look closely, you will see that there are two versions after the <code>fabric-loader-</code> part, separated by a dash. The first one is the Fabric Loader version itself, the second one is the Minecraft version that it's for.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Minecraft version is the part that matters. If this is wrong, your installation won't launch.

                        Wurst actually has three different GUIs that you can choose from:

                        <li>
                            <p>The GUI with the litte windows is called <a href="https://wiki.wurstclient.net/clickgui">ClickGUI</a> and opens with Right CTRL by default.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The GUI with the search bar at the top is called <a href="https://wiki.wurstclient.net/navigator">Navigator</a> and opens with Right Shift by default.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>There is also a TabGUI, which I wouldn't recommend for beginners and does not open with a keybind by default. You can read more about it <a href="https://wiki.wurstclient.net/tabgui">here</a>.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Keep in mind you cannot open Wurst's GUI directly from the title screen. It only works while playing on a server or in a singleplayer world.
                        If it still doesn't work there, double-check if Wurst is actually running or if it's <a href="#still-launches-vanilla">just vanilla Minecraft</a>.

                        Fabric's error messages are usually really good at explaining what's wrong and the "potential" solution that it gives you is almost always the correct solution.
                        You should absolutely just follow the instructions listed in the error message.

                                This error happens when you use a Fabric Loader version older than 0.14 with a Minecraft 1.19 snapshot.

                            <p>
                                Minecraft 1.19 snapshots require Fabric Loader 0.14.0 or newer, but for some reason the Fabric installer selects 0.13.3 by default.

                                You should <a href="#fabric-loader">run the Fabric installer again</a> and this time manually select the latest Fabric Loader version.

                                After doing this, you will have multiple <code>fabric-loader-...</code> installations in your Minecraft Launcher.
                                Make sure to select the correct one so you don't get the same error again.

                        Like "Incompatible mod set!", this error message usually means that you didn't follow the tutorial properly.
                        Unfortunately the official Minecraft launcher sucks at providing useful error messages, so the usual "Exit Code: 1" can mean almost anything.

                        A common cause of this error is that you installed a version of Wurst that is not compatible with your Minecraft version.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Double-check which Wurst version is in your mods folder (the "MC" part indicates which Minecraft version it's intended for) and <a href="#wurst">go back to step 3</a> if it's the wrong version.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another possible cause is that you selected a very old version of Fabric Loader in the Fabric installer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is generally no good reason to use anything else than the latest version of Fabric Loader (which is selected by default).
                        You should <a href="#fabric-loader">go back to step 1</a> and this time leave the "Loader Version" at its default value.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If all of your mod versions and Fabric Loader are correct but the game is still crashing, it is possible that you have found a bug.
                        Unfortunately it seems like the official Minecraft launcher no longer gives you access to crash report files.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Try to get a copy of the stack trace (maybe in the log files?) or see if the same crash also happens with a launcher that doesn't disable crash report files.

                        Look closely. Is it really vanilla or is it Fabric without Wurst? You will see "Fabric (Modded)" at the bottom if it's Fabric.

                                Most likely, you simply launched the wrong installation.
                                You should go back to the Minecraft launcher and double-check which installation you just launched.

                                Most likely, you placed your <code>mods</code> folder in the wrong location.
                                Make sure that the folder is called exactly <code>mods</code> and that its location is exactly as follows:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>Windows:</b> <code>C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods</code>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>Linux:</b> <code>/home/YourName/.minecraft/mods</code>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>Mac:</b> <code>/home/YourName/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods</code>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If the folder name and location are correct but you still have this issue, you probably changed the the <code>GAME DIRECTORY</code> option in your <code>fabric-loader-...</code> installation.

                                You should go back to the Minecraft launcher, edit your installation and change <code>GAME DIRECTORY</code> back to its default value.
