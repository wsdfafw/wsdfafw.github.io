			<summary id="launch-player-safety-warning">The Minecraft launcher is warning me about "player safety features".</summary>
			<p>
				This is normal, unfortunately. Microsoft has decided to try and scare people away from modding by adding these "player safety" warnings to all modded installations.
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="https://twitter.com/Wurst_Imperium/status/1353927165012811776" target="_blank">These warnings are complete nonsense and have nothing to do with actual safety!</a>
			</p>

				You can safely disable these warnings and launch the game.

				Or alternatively, switch to a <a href="https://multimc.org/" target="_blank">better launcher</a> that respects your freedom and doesn't lie about safety.
			</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary id="launch-cant-see-loader-installation">I can't see the <code>fabric-loader-...</code> installation.</summary>
			<p>
				First make sure that the "Modded" checkbox is enabled. Modded installations like Fabric are invisible without it.

			</p>
			<p>
				If you already had the Minecraft launcher open while you were installing Fabric (Loader), it is possible that you need to restart the Minecraft Launcher to make it "realize" that there is a new installation.
			</p>
			<p>
				If none of that helps, you probably don't have the installation. You can either <a href="#create-profile-automatically">run the Fabric installer again</a>, or <a href="#create-profile-manually">create the installation manually</a>.
			</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary id="create-profile-automatically">I turned off "Create profile" earlier and now I don't have the <code>fabric-loader-...</code> installation.</summary>
			<p>
				Simply run the Fabric installer again, just like you did in <a href="#fabric-loader">step 1</a>.
				Select the same version as before, but this time make sure that "Create profile" is enabled, and then press "Install".
				The installer won't complain that you already did this.

			<summary id="create-profile-manually">I want to create the <code>fabric-loader-...</code> installation myself. Show me how to do it!</summary>

					<p>
						Okay, let me explain to you how these versions work. If you look closely, you will see that there are two versions after the <code>fabric-loader-</code> part, separated by a dash. The first one is the Fabric Loader version itself, the second one is the Minecraft version that it's for.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Minecraft version is the part that matters. If this is wrong, your installation won't launch.
					</p>
					<p>
						<img src="https://images.wurstclient.net/_media/install_loader_version.webp" alt="how to read a Fabric Loader version">
					</p>
					<p>
						Now with that knowledge, choose any <code>release fabric-loader-...</code> option for the Minecraft version you plan to use. (I'm using Minecraft 1.18.2 in the above example.)

					<summary id="create-profile-loader-release-missing">I don't see a <code>release fabric-loader-...</code> option for my Minecraft version.</summary>

		<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
		<details>
			<summary id="open-gui">OK great, but now how do I open Wurst's GUI?</summary>
			<p>
				Wurst actually has three different GUIs that you can choose from:
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="https://images.wurstclient.net/_media/gui_keybinds.webp" alt="visualization of Wurst's GUI keybinds" title="Thanks to keyboard-layout-editor.com for this image!">
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>The GUI with the litte windows is called <a href="https://wiki.wurstclient.net/clickgui">ClickGUI</a> and opens with Right CTRL by default.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The GUI with the search bar at the top is called <a href="https://wiki.wurstclient.net/navigator">Navigator</a> and opens with Right Shift by default.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>There is also a TabGUI, which I wouldn't recommend for beginners and does not open with a keybind by default. You can read more about it <a href="https://wiki.wurstclient.net/tabgui">here</a>.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Keep in mind you cannot open Wurst's GUI directly from the title screen. It only works while playing on a server or in a singleplayer world.
				If it still doesn't work there, double-check if Wurst is actually running or if it's <a href="#still-launches-vanilla">just vanilla Minecraft</a>.
			</p>

				Generally speaking, this means you didn't follow the tutorial properly.
				Fabric's error messages are usually really good at explaining what's wrong and the "potential" solution that it gives you is almost always the correct solution.
				You should absolutely just follow the instructions listed in the error message.

				But, *sigh* since I know some of you won't be satisfied with that answer, here is a list of common error messages / solutions and what they mean:

			<summary id="launch-just-crashes">I see an error message saying <code>An unexpected issue occurred and the game has crashed</code>.</summary>
			<p>
				Like "Incompatible mod set!", this error message usually means that you didn't follow the tutorial properly.
				Unfortunately the official Minecraft launcher sucks at providing useful error messages, so the usual "Exit Code: 1" can mean almost anything.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="https://images.wurstclient.net/_media/install_error_generic_crash.webp" alt="the Minecraft launcher's useless error message">
			</p>
			<p>
				A common cause of this error is that you installed a version of Wurst that is not compatible with your Minecraft version.
			</p>
			<p>
				Double-check which Wurst version is in your mods folder (the "MC" part indicates which Minecraft version it's intended for) and <a href="#wurst">go back to step 3</a> if it's the wrong version.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="https://images.wurstclient.net/_media/install_error_wrong_wurst_version.webp" alt="an example of using the wrong Wurst version (MC1.16.5) in a Minecraft 1.18.2 installation">
			</p>
			<p>
				Another possible cause is that you selected a very old version of Fabric Loader in the Fabric installer.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is generally no good reason to use anything else than the latest version of Fabric Loader (which is selected by default).
				You should <a href="#fabric-loader">go back to step 1</a> and this time leave the "Loader Version" at its default value.
			</p>

				<img src="https://images.wurstclient.net/_media/install_error_very_old_fabric_loader.webp" alt="an example of a very old Fabric Loader version that will crash a Minecraft 1.18.2 installation">
			</p>
			<p>
				If all of your mod versions and Fabric Loader are correct but the game is still crashing, it is possible that you have found a bug.
				Unfortunately it seems like the official Minecraft launcher no longer gives you access to crash report files.
			</p>
			<p>
				Try to get a copy of the stack trace (maybe in the log files?) or see if the same crash also happens with a launcher that doesn't disable crash report files.

				</details>
				<details>
					<summary id="launches-fabric-without-wurst">It's Fabric, but without Wurst.</summary>
					<p>
						Most likely, you placed your <code>mods</code> folder in the wrong location.
						Make sure that the folder is called exactly <code>mods</code> and that its location is exactly as follows:
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Windows:</b> <code>C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods</code>
					</p>

						<b>Linux:</b> <code>/home/YourName/.minecraft/mods</code>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Mac:</b> <code>/home/YourName/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods</code>
					</p>
					<p>
						If the folder name and location are correct but you still have this issue, you probably changed the the <code>GAME DIRECTORY</code> option in your <code>fabric-loader-...</code> installation.

					<p>
						<img src="https://images.wurstclient.net/_media/install_error_wrong_game_directory.webp" alt="example of a changed game directory that can prevent Fabric from finding your mods">
