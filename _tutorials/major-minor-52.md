This crash happens when trying to launch Minecraft with an outdated Java version.

It can occur even if you already have the latest Java version, since it is possible to have multiple Java versions installed at the same time.

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. Remove **all** of your Java installations.

2. Download and install the latest Java from [Java.com/download](https://www.java.com/download/).

3. Download and install the latest Minecraft launcher from [Minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net/).
